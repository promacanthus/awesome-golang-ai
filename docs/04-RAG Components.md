# RAG Components

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful architectural pattern that enhances the accuracy and reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources during inference. This document provides a comprehensive overview of RAG components available in the Go ecosystem, focusing on Document Parsers, Pipeline and Data Versioning tools, Embedding libraries, and Vector Databases. The repository analyzed is a curated list of AI-related tools and libraries for Go, serving as a valuable resource for developers building AI applications with Golang. While the repository itself does not contain implementation code, it catalogs prominent tools and frameworks that can be used to construct complete RAG systems.

## RAG Architecture Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture combines the generative capabilities of Large Language Models with external knowledge retrieval to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. The RAG process follows a two-phase approach: an offline indexing phase and an online retrieval-generation phase. In the indexing phase, documents are parsed, chunked into smaller segments, converted to vector embeddings using embedding models, and stored in a vector database with appropriate metadata. During inference, a user query is similarly converted to an embedding, used to retrieve the most relevant document chunks from the vector database, and then combined with the original query as context for the LLM to generate a response. This architecture significantly improves LLM accuracy by grounding responses in verifiable external knowledge, reduces hallucinations, and enables models to answer questions about domain-specific or up-to-date information not present in their training data.

## Document Parsers

Document parsers are responsible for extracting text content from various file formats and converting them into a structured format suitable for downstream processing in RAG pipelines. These tools handle the complexities of different document structures, formatting, and encoding to ensure high-fidelity text extraction. In the Go ecosystem, while there are limited native document parsing libraries specifically for RAG, several powerful tools can be integrated into Go applications. The repository lists several document parsing tools, though many are implemented in other languages like Python. For Go applications, developers can either use these tools via subprocess calls or look for Go-native alternatives that provide similar functionality.

### Prominent Document Parsing Tools
