## Model Definition and Training Workflows

The Go ML ecosystem supports various model definition and training paradigms, though specific implementation details for tensor operations and gradient computation are not provided in the repository.

Based on the libraries described, model definition in Go typically follows one of several patterns:

1. Imperative programming: Direct implementation of algorithms using Go's native syntax and control structures
2. Computational graphs: Declarative definition of operations using frameworks like Gorgonia
3. High-level APIs: Using pre-built components and estimators as in Golearn

For gradient computation, Gorgonia likely implements reverse-mode automatic differentiation, enabling efficient computation of gradients for neural network training. This capability is essential for implementing backpropagation in deep learning models.

Model training workflows in Go leverage the language's concurrency features to potentially parallelize operations across multiple cores. Libraries like CloudForest explicitly mention multi-threading support for decision tree ensembles, suggesting that performance optimization through parallel execution is a design consideration in the ecosystem.

The regression library provides multivariable regression capabilities, while ridge implements ridge regression, offering regularized linear models for scenarios with multicollinearity or overfitting concerns.
